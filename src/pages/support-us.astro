            <p>
              Islam has great emphasis on helping people in need. This is why some contributions from our earning are obligatory such as Khums, Zakat/Fitrana, some are highly recommended like giving sadqa on specific days or occasions and some recommended to help us get closer to Allah Al-Mighty and ward off hardships.
